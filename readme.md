# Shiny Interactive Story Board
Welcome to a proof of concept of an interactive storyboard with shiny and R-studio analysing data from Spainish beaches.
My objective with this work was practice with the tool and create nice graphics and visualization from the data. You can find this work published in Shinyapps.io [Here!](https://fernandocr.shinyapps.io/Playas_Espana/)
